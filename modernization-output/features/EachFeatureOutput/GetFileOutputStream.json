  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the following inputs:\n     * sizeThreshold (number): Maximum size in bytes before content is stored on disk\n     * repository (object): Directory where temporary files will be stored\n     * tempFile (object): Optional pre-defined temporary file location\n   - System will generate:\n     * Unique file identifier for temporary file naming\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate sizeThreshold:\n     * IF sizeThreshold is negative or zero THEN\n       - Set to default threshold value\n     * END IF\n   - Validate repository location:\n     * IF repository is null THEN\n       - Use system temporary directory as default repository\n     * ELSE\n       - Verify repository directory exists\n       - Verify repository directory is writable\n       - IF repository is not valid THEN\n         - Use system temporary directory as fallback\n       - END IF\n     * END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if output stream already exists:\n     * IF output stream has been previously created THEN\n       - Return existing output stream without creating a new one\n     * END IF\n   - Determine temporary file location:\n     * IF tempFile is provided THEN\n       - Use provided tempFile\n     * ELSE\n       - Generate unique temporary file name\n       - Create file reference in repository directory\n     * END IF\n   - Verify system resources:\n     * Check available disk space in repository location\n     * IF insufficient disk space THEN\n       - Prepare error response\n     * END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Create deferred file output stream:\n     * Initialize stream with provided size threshold\n     * Associate stream with temporary file location\n     * Configure stream to store content in memory until threshold is exceeded\n     * Register temporary file for automatic cleanup when no longer needed\n   - Set up stream monitoring:\n     * Track whether content is stored in memory or on disk\n     * Prepare for potential stream closure operations\n   - Initialize stream for writing:\n     * Open file handles if needed\n     * Prepare buffer management\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return output stream object:\n     * Provide stream interface for writing file contents\n     * Include reference to underlying storage mechanism\n   - In case of errors:\n     * Generate appropriate error information\n     * Include details about the failure reason\n     * Provide guidance on possible resolution steps",
