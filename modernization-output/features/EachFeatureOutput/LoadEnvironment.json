  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - rootDirectory: mandatory string representing the base directory path\n   - configPath: mandatory string representing the path to configuration files\n   - applicationPath: system-generated based on rootDirectory\n   - installationConfigPath: system-generated based on configuration settings\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate rootDirectory:\n     * Check if directory exists\n     * Verify read permissions are available\n     * IF directory does not exist or is not readable THEN\n       > Generate error message: \"Invalid root directory path\"\n       > Terminate process\n   - Validate configPath:\n     * Check if configuration file exists at the specified path\n     * Verify file is readable\n     * IF configuration file does not exist or is not readable THEN\n       > Generate error message: \"Configuration file not found or not accessible\"\n       > Terminate process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Determine application root directory:\n     * IF rootDirectory is not explicitly provided THEN\n       > Detect current execution context location\n       > Calculate root directory based on execution context\n     * Set application path based on root directory\n   - Check for installation configuration:\n     * Determine path to installation configuration file\n     * Check if installation configuration file exists\n     * IF installation configuration exists THEN\n       > Mark system as installed\n     * ELSE\n       > Mark system as not fully installed\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Initialize global system settings:\n     * Load default configuration from primary configuration file\n     * Set base application paths in the system\n     * IF installation configuration exists THEN\n       > Load additional settings from installation configuration\n       > Override default settings with installation-specific values\n   - Configure template engine:\n     * Create template engine configuration\n     * Set template directory path based on application path\n     * Set template update parameters\n     * Register template configuration with execution context\n   - Load internationalization resources:\n     * Identify available language files\n     * Load default language resources\n     * IF custom language is specified in configuration THEN\n       > Load custom language resources\n   - Initialize system components:\n     * Set up logging framework\n     * Initialize cache mechanisms\n     * Prepare execution context\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Success response:\n     * Return initialization status indicator\n     * Provide summary of loaded configuration files\n     * Include information about system readiness\n   - Error response:\n     * Detailed error message indicating failure point\n     * Suggested troubleshooting steps\n     * System state information for diagnosis",
