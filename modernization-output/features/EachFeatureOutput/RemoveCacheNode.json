No default value is provided\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate the provided fully qualified name (fqn)\n     2.1. Check if the fqn is not null\n        IF fqn is null THEN\n           Return error: \"Cache node fully qualified name cannot be null\"\n     2.2. Check if the fqn is not an empty string\n        IF fqn is empty THEN\n           Return error: \"Cache node fully qualified name cannot be empty\"\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify cache system state\n     3.1. Check if the cache system is initialized\n        IF cache system is not initialized THEN\n           Return error: \"Cache system is not initialized\"\n     3.2. Check if the node exists in the cache\n        IF node does not exist in cache THEN\n           Return warning: \"Cache node does not exist\"\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Remove the cache node\n     4.1. Locate the node in the cache structure using the provided fqn\n     4.2. Remove the entire node and all its contents from the cache\n     4.3. Release any resources associated with the node\n     4.4. IF removal operation fails THEN\n           Log the failure details\n           Return error: \"Failed to remove cache node\"\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate appropriate response\n     5.1. IF node removal is successful THEN\n           Return success: \"Cache node successfully removed\"\n     5.2. IF node removal fails THEN\n           Include specific error details in the response\n     5.3. Include information about the removed node in the success response",
