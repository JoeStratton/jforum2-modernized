  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the POPConnector object which contains connection to the email server\n   - The connector must be properly initialized and connected to the mail server\n   - No additional user inputs are required as this is a system operation\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate POPConnector object:\n      * Verify the connector is not null\n      * Verify the connector has an active connection to the mail server\n      * IF connector validation fails, THEN generate appropriate error message and terminate process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check system readiness:\n      * Verify system has sufficient memory to process incoming messages\n      * Verify storage capacity for message list\n      * IF system resources are insufficient, THEN log warning and continue with limited processing\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Initialize an empty message collection to store processed messages\n   - Request list of messages from the connector:\n      * Call the connector's listMessages method to retrieve all available messages\n      * IF message retrieval fails, THEN log error and return empty list\n   - Process each message in the retrieved collection:\n      * FOR each message in the connector's message list:\n         > Create a new message object to store the parsed message\n         > Extract message content and metadata\n         > Add the processed message to the message collection\n         > Log successful message processing\n      * END FOR\n   - Finalize message processing:\n      * Verify all messages were processed correctly\n      * Log summary of processing results\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the collection of processed messages\n   - IF no messages were processed, THEN return empty collection\n   - Include count of successfully processed messages in log\n   - Include any processing warnings or errors in log",
