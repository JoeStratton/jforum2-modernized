  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the required directory path (string) where the index will be created\n   - Validate that the directory path is provided and not empty\n   - System will use the configured analyzer for index creation\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate directory path format:\n     a. Check if the directory path is not null or empty\n     b. Verify the path string has valid filesystem path format\n     c. Ensure the path has appropriate read/write permissions\n     d. IF validation fails, THEN generate appropriate error message\n   - Validate system state:\n     a. Check if the system has necessary resources to create directory\n     b. Verify that no conflicting operations are in progress\n     c. IF system state validation fails, THEN abort operation and report error\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if an index already exists at the specified location:\n     a. IF index exists at the specified path, THEN\n        i. Abort operation to prevent overwriting existing index\n        ii. Generate appropriate error message about existing index\n     b. ELSE continue with directory creation\n   - Verify storage capacity:\n     a. Check if sufficient disk space is available for index creation\n     b. IF insufficient space, THEN abort and report error\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Prepare for index directory creation:\n     a. Initialize the filesystem directory object\n     b. Configure the index writer with the system analyzer\n     c. Set index creation flag to true (indicating new index creation)\n   - Create the index directory:\n     a. Create physical directory structure if it doesn't exist\n     b. Initialize empty index with required metadata\n     c. Write initial index structure to disk\n     d. Close the index writer to release resources\n   - Handle potential failures:\n     a. IF any I/O errors occur during creation, THEN\n        i. Clean up any partially created files\n        ii. Log detailed error information\n        iii. Generate appropriate error response\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - For successful creation:\n     a. Generate success confirmation message\n     b. Include the path of the newly created index directory\n     c. Provide information about the index status (empty, ready for use)\n   - For failed creation:\n     a. Generate detailed error message explaining the failure reason\n     b. Provide troubleshooting suggestions based on error type\n     c. Include system contact information for further assistance",
