Data Validation\n   - Validate the topic ID:\n     - Check if topicId is provided\n     - Verify topicId is a positive integer\n     - Verify the topic exists in the system\n     - If any validation fails, generate appropriate error message\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Check if the topic is in a valid state for decrementing replies:\n     - Verify the topic has at least one reply (total replies > 0)\n     - IF total replies count is already 0, THEN\n       - Log warning about attempting to decrement below zero\n       - Exit process without making changes\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Decrement the total replies count for the specified topic:\n     - Retrieve the current reply count for the topic\n     - Subtract one from the current reply count\n     - Update the topic record with the new reply count\n     - IF update operation fails, THEN\n       - Log the error details\n       - Revert any partial changes\n       - Generate appropriate error response\n     - END IF\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - IF operation is successful, THEN\n     - Return success status\n     - Include the updated reply count in the response\n   - ELSE\n     - Return error status\n     - Include error details and suggestions for resolution\n   - END IF",
