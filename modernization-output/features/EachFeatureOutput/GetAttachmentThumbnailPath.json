  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the attachment object with its associated information\n     1.1. Verify the attachment object is not null\n     1.2. Ensure the attachment contains info property with physical filename\n     1.3. System will use configuration settings for path construction\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate the attachment data is complete and accessible\n     2.1. Verify the attachment info object exists\n        2.1.1. IF attachment info is null THEN return error indicating missing attachment information\n     2.2. Verify the physical filename exists in the attachment info\n        2.2.1. IF physical filename is empty or null THEN return error indicating invalid attachment\n     2.3. Validate system configuration is available\n        2.3.1. Ensure upload directory configuration exists\n        2.3.2. IF configuration is missing THEN return error indicating system configuration issue\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Determine the thumbnail path based on system configuration and attachment data\n     3.1. Retrieve the base upload directory from system configuration\n        3.1.1. Get the value for attachments upload directory from system settings\n     3.2. Combine the base directory with attachment's physical filename\n        3.2.1. Append the physical filename from the attachment info\n        3.2.2. Append the \"_thumb\" suffix to indicate this is a thumbnail path\n     3.3. Format the path according to system requirements\n        3.3.1. Ensure proper directory separators are used\n        3.3.2. Normalize the path if required by the system\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Construct the complete thumbnail path\n     4.1. Start with the base upload directory path\n     4.2. Add directory separator character\n     4.3. Append the physical filename of the attachment\n     4.4. Append the \"_thumb\" suffix to the filename\n     4.5. Combine all elements into a complete file path string\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the constructed thumbnail path\n     5.1. IF path construction is successful THEN return the complete thumbnail path string\n     5.2. IF any errors occurred during path construction THEN return appropriate error message\n     5.3. Include the path format in the response for reference",
