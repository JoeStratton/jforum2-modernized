  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection\n   - Collect the filename (string) that has changed\n   - The filename is mandatory and system-provided\n   - No default values are applicable\n\n2. Data Validation\n   - Validate filename input:\n     a. Check if filename is not null or empty\n        IF filename is null or empty THEN\n          Generate error: \"Filename cannot be empty\"\n        END IF\n     b. Check if filename string is properly formatted\n        IF filename format is invalid THEN\n          Generate error: \"Invalid filename format\"\n        END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Verify system state for notification processing\n     a. Check if notification system is active\n        IF notification system is inactive THEN\n          Log warning and exit process\n        END IF\n     b. Verify listener registration status\n        IF no listeners are registered THEN\n          Log information about lack of listeners\n          Exit process without notifications\n        END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Process file change notification\n     a. Prepare notification data package with filename\n     b. For each registered listener:\n        i. Deliver notification with filename to the listener\n        ii. IF delivery fails THEN\n             Log delivery failure\n             Continue to next listener\n           END IF\n     c. Record notification delivery status\n        IF any delivery failed THEN\n          Log summary of failed notifications\n        END IF\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - Generate notification completion response\n     a. IF all notifications were successful THEN\n          Return success status with notification count\n        ELSE\n          Return partial success with details of failed notifications\n        END IF\n     b. Include timestamp of notification processing\n     c. Include summary of notification recipients",
