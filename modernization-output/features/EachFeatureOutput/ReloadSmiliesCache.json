Data Validation:\n   - Verify administrator privileges\n     - IF user does not have administrator privileges THEN\n       - Generate access denied error\n       - Terminate process\n     - END IF\n   - Verify system readiness for cache operation\n     - IF system is in maintenance mode THEN\n       - Queue operation for later execution\n       - Notify administrator of deferred execution\n       - Terminate process\n     - END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check system resource availability\n     - IF system memory usage is above threshold THEN\n       - Log warning about potential performance impact\n     - END IF\n   - Verify smilies data source accessibility\n     - IF data source is unavailable THEN\n       - Generate data source error\n       - Log failure to access smilies data\n       - Terminate process\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Clear existing smilies from cache\n     - Remove all current emoticon definitions from memory\n     - Release associated resources\n   - Load smilies from data source\n     - Retrieve all emoticon definitions from database\n     - Parse emoticon data (codes, image paths, descriptions)\n     - Create optimized cache structure for emoticons\n   - Store smilies in system cache\n     - Organize emoticons by categories if applicable\n     - Index emoticons for efficient lookup\n     - Apply any configured sorting rules\n   - IF any errors occur during loading THEN\n     - Attempt to restore previous cache state\n     - Log cache restoration attempt result\n   - END IF\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate operation summary\n     - Include number of emoticons loaded\n     - Include cache memory usage statistics\n     - Include operation timestamp\n   - Display success message to administrator\n     - Confirm successful cache reload\n     - Show cache statistics summary\n   - Log cache reload event\n     - Record administrator who performed action\n     - Record operation timestamp\n     - Record operation success status",
