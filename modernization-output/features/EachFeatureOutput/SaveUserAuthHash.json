Data Validation:\n   - Validate userId:\n      * Verify userId is a positive integer\n      * Verify userId exists in the system\n      * If validation fails, generate appropriate error message\n   - Validate hash:\n      * Verify hash is not empty\n      * Verify hash meets security requirements (proper format and length)\n      * If validation fails, generate appropriate error message\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify system is in a valid state for updating user security information\n   - Check if user account is active\n   - Verify user has appropriate permissions for security hash updates\n   - IF user is deleted or inactive THEN\n      * Generate appropriate error message\n      * Abort operation\n   - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Locate user record using userId\n   - Update the security hash field for the specified user\n   - IF update operation fails THEN\n      * Log the failure reason\n      * Revert any partial changes\n      * Generate appropriate error message\n   - END IF\n   - Commit the changes to the database\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - IF operation is successful THEN\n      * Generate success response indicating hash was saved\n      * Include confirmation of the operation\n   - ELSE\n      * Generate error response with appropriate details\n      * Include guidance on resolving the issue\n   - END IF",
