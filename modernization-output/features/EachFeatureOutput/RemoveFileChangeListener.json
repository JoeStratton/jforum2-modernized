Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the filename is a valid string\n   - Check if the filename is currently being monitored\n     - IF filename is not in the list of monitored files THEN\n       - Generate appropriate notification that the file is not being monitored\n       - Exit the process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify system has appropriate permissions to modify monitoring settings\n   - Check if any dependent processes require this file monitoring to continue\n     - IF dependent processes exist THEN\n       - Generate warning about potential impacts\n       - Request confirmation to proceed\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Retrieve the monitoring task associated with the filename from the storage\n   - Cancel the scheduled monitoring task\n     - Stop any active monitoring processes for this file\n     - Release resources associated with this monitoring task\n   - Remove the file entry from the monitored files list\n     - Update internal tracking to reflect the change\n\n5.
