  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   1.1. Collect the following required inputs:\n       - name (string): The descriptive text label for the form field\n       - id (string): The unique identifier associated with the form field\n       - selected (boolean): The selection state of the form field\n   1.2. All fields are mandatory for proper field selection management\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   2.1. Validate the name field:\n       - IF name is null or empty THEN\n         - Generate error message: \"Field name cannot be empty\"\n       - IF name exceeds maximum allowed length THEN\n         - Generate error message: \"Field name exceeds maximum allowed length\"\n   2.2. Validate the id field:\n       - IF id is null or empty THEN\n         - Generate error message: \"Field ID cannot be empty\"\n       - IF id is not unique within the current form context THEN\n         - Generate error message: \"Field ID must be unique\"\n   2.3. Validate the selected field:\n       - Ensure the selected value is a valid boolean (true or false)\n       - IF selected is not a valid boolean THEN\n         - Default to false\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   3.1. Check for field visibility rules:\n       - IF the field has dependencies on other field selections THEN\n         - Verify those dependencies are satisfied\n       - IF dependencies are not satisfied THEN\n         - Log warning about potential inconsistent state\n   3.2. Check for mutually exclusive selections:\n       - IF this field belongs to a mutually exclusive group AND selected is true THEN\n         - Ensure other fields in the same group are set to not selected\n   3.3. Check for required group selections:\n       - IF this field belongs to a group where at least one selection is required THEN\n         - Verify at least one field in the group will be selected\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   4.1. Create or update the form field selection data:\n       - Store the name value for display purposes\n       - Store the id value for field identification\n       - Store the selected state for rendering the field\n   4.2. Update related field states if necessary:\n       - IF this field controls the visibility of other fields THEN\n         - Update the visibility state of dependent fields\n       - IF this field is part of a mutually exclusive group AND selected is true THEN\n         - Update other fields in the group to not selected\n   4.3. Prepare the field data for UI rendering:\n       - Format the field data for appropriate display in the user interface\n       - Include any additional rendering hints based on the field state\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   5.1. For successful field selection management:\n       - Return the complete field data object with name, id, and selected state\n       - Include any additional rendering information for the UI\n   5.2. For validation failures:\n       - Return appropriate error messages for each validation failure\n       - Maintain the current field state without changes\n   5.3. For business rule violations:\n       - Return warnings about potential inconsistent states\n       - Provide guidance on resolving the inconsistencies",
