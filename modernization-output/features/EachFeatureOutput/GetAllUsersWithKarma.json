Data Validation\n   - Validate input parameters:\n     - IF startFrom is provided, THEN ensure it is a non-negative integer\n     - IF count is provided, THEN ensure it is a non-negative integer\n     - IF invalid parameters are detected, THEN prepare appropriate error message\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Check system state:\n     - Verify that the user database is accessible\n     - Verify that the karma system is enabled\n     - IF system is in maintenance mode, THEN abort operation and return appropriate message\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Retrieve users from the system:\n     - IF both startFrom and count parameters are provided and valid:\n       - Retrieve limited set of users starting from the specified index\n     - ELSE:\n       - Retrieve all users from the system\n   - For each retrieved user:\n     - Load basic user information (id, username, email, registration date, post count, etc.)\n     - Load associated karma information\n     - Combine user and karma data into a unified user object\n   - Organize retrieved users into a structured list\n   - IF no users are found, THEN prepare empty result list\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - Prepare response with the following information:\n     - List of user objects with their karma information\n     - Total count of users retrieved\n     - Pagination information if applicable\n     - IF an error occurred during processing, THEN include appropriate error details\n     - Return the complete response to the caller",
