  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Obtain a reference to the DiskFileItem object\n   - No additional inputs are required as the filename is already stored within the object\n   - The filename is a system-stored value that was captured during file upload\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Verify that the DiskFileItem object is not null\n     * IF DiskFileItem is null THEN\n       - Return an appropriate error message indicating invalid input\n     * END IF\n   - No additional validation is required as this is a retrieval operation\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if the file information is available\n     * IF file information was not properly captured during upload THEN\n       - Return an empty or default filename value\n     * END IF\n   - No additional business rules apply to this retrieval operation\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Access the stored filename property from the DiskFileItem object\n   - Return the filename value as stored during the upload process\n   - No modifications are made to the filename during retrieval\n   - No database operations are performed during this operation\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the original filename as a string value\n   - IF retrieval is successful THEN\n     * Return the filename string\n   - ELSE\n     * Return an appropriate error message\n   - END IF",
