  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect request object with user session information\n   - Collect response object for redirection handling\n   - System-generated installation status flag\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate request object is properly initialized\n     * Check if request contains required context path\n     * Verify request encoding is properly set\n   - Validate response object is properly initialized\n     * Ensure response can handle redirects\n     * Verify response encoding is properly set\n   - Validate system installation status\n     * Check if system installation flag is accessible\n     * Verify the flag contains a valid boolean value\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check system installation status\n     * IF system is already installed (installation flag is TRUE)\n       THEN prepare for redirection to forums list\n     * IF system is not installed (installation flag is FALSE)\n       THEN allow normal installation process to continue\n   - Determine appropriate destination URL\n     * Construct forums list URL using context path and appropriate extension\n     * Format URL according to system configuration\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Handle installed system scenario\n     * IF system is installed\n       THEN set redirection target to forums list URL\n       AND prepare system for redirect operation\n     * IF system is not installed\n       THEN continue with normal installation flow\n       AND prepare system to display installation interface\n   - Prepare execution context\n     * Set appropriate flags for subsequent processing\n     * Store redirection information if applicable\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Process redirection if required\n     * IF redirection is set\n       THEN encode redirection URL for security\n       AND send redirect instruction to client\n     * IF no redirection is needed\n       THEN continue with normal response processing\n   - Complete request handling\n     * Ensure all resources are properly released\n     * Finalize execution context",
