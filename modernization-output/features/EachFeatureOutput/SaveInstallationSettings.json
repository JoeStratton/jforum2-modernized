  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection\n   - Collect the following inputs:\n     a. installationConfig (string, mandatory): Path to the installation configuration file\n     b. configurationValues (object, mandatory): Collection of key-value pairs representing configuration settings\n     c. System-generated timestamp (date, system-generated): Current date and time for tracking when settings were saved\n\n2. Data Validation\n   - Validate installation configuration file path:\n     a. Check if the path is not empty\n     b. Verify the path format is valid for the operating system\n     c. Ensure the directory exists and is writable\n     d. IF validation fails, THEN generate appropriate error message\n   - Validate configuration values:\n     a. Verify the configuration object is not null\n     b. Check that required configuration keys are present\n     c. Validate that values have appropriate data types for their respective settings\n     d. IF any validation fails, THEN generate detailed error message indicating which setting is invalid\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Check system state:\n     a. Verify the system is in a state that allows configuration changes\n     b. Ensure no other process is currently modifying the configuration file\n     c. IF the system is in an invalid state, THEN abort the operation and return appropriate error\n   - Verify user permissions:\n     a. Check if the current user has sufficient privileges to modify system settings\n     b. IF user lacks permissions, THEN generate an access denied error\n   - Validate configuration consistency:\n     a. Ensure the new configuration values don't conflict with each other\n     b. Verify the new settings won't cause system instability\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Prepare configuration data:\n     a. Create a sorted collection of all configuration properties\n     b. Format each property as a key-value pair\n     c. Add metadata including save timestamp and user information\n   - Create backup of existing configuration:\n     a. Check if the configuration file already exists\n     b. IF file exists, THEN create a backup copy with timestamp\n     c. Store backup in designated backup location\n   - Write configuration to file:\n     a. Create output stream to the configuration file\n     b. Write header information including timestamp and purpose\n     c. Write each configuration property in sorted order\n     d. Ensure proper formatting of the configuration file\n     e. Close the output stream properly\n     f. IF any error occurs during write, THEN restore from backup and report error\n   - Update runtime configuration:\n     a. Update the in-memory configuration with new values\n     b. Clear any cached values that depend on the changed settings\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - Success response:\n     a. Generate confirmation message that settings were saved successfully\n     b. Include timestamp of when the settings were saved\n     c. Provide summary of changes made (new settings vs. previous settings)\n   - Error response:\n     a. Detailed error message explaining what went wrong\n     b. Suggested remediation steps\n     c. Technical details for troubleshooting (for admin users)\n   - Notification:\n     a. Log the configuration change in system logs\n     b. Notify administrators about the configuration change if required",
