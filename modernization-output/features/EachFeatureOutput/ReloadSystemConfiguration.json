  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the filename (string) of the changed configuration file\n   - System will automatically detect when a monitored file changes\n   - No user input required as this is a system-triggered process\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate the filename exists in the system\n     * IF filename is null or empty THEN\n       - Log an error message\n       - Abort the reload process\n     * IF file does not exist in the system THEN\n       - Log a warning message\n       - Abort the reload process\n   - Validate the file has proper read permissions\n     * IF file cannot be read THEN\n       - Log an error message about permission issues\n       - Abort the reload process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if system is in a state where configuration can be reloaded\n     * IF system is currently initializing THEN\n       - Queue the reload request for later processing\n       - Exit the current process\n     * IF another reload operation is in progress THEN\n       - Queue this request or skip based on system policy\n       - Log appropriate message\n   - Determine configuration type based on filename\n     * IF file is a core configuration file THEN\n       - Mark for complete system reload\n     * IF file is a module-specific configuration THEN\n       - Mark only affected modules for reload\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Log the start of reload operation with filename information\n   - Initialize the configuration reload process\n     * Reset configuration cache for affected components\n     * Load new configuration values from the changed file\n     * Apply new configuration values to the system\n   - Update dependent components\n     * Notify all registered configuration listeners about changes\n     * Restart services that require restart after configuration changes\n   - Verify configuration integrity\n     * Check for missing required configuration values\n     * Validate configuration value formats and ranges\n     * IF validation fails THEN\n       - Log detailed error information\n       - Attempt to restore previous configuration\n       - Notify administrators about configuration issues\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Log the completion status of the reload operation\n     * IF reload was successful THEN\n       - Log success message with details of changes applied\n       - Update system status indicators\n     * IF reload failed THEN\n       - Log detailed error information\n       - Indicate which parts of the system may be affected\n       - Provide recovery suggestions\n   - Notify administrators about the configuration change\n     * Include timestamp, filename, and reload status\n     * Provide summary of significant configuration changes",
