Data Validation:\n   - Verify job execution context is valid\n   - Check if summary generation is enabled in system settings\n   - Validate that the current time is appropriate for sending summaries\n   - Ensure database connections are available\n   - IF any validation fails, THEN log error and terminate job execution\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Determine summary period (daily, weekly) based on system configuration\n   - Calculate time range for posts to include in summary\n   - Check system resources availability for processing\n   - Verify email service availability\n   - IF email service is unavailable, THEN log error and terminate job\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Retrieve list of recipients who have subscribed to summaries\n   - FOR each recipient:\n     a.

IF no new posts exist for recipient, THEN skip to next recipient\n     d. Format post data into digestible summary format\n     e. Generate personalized email content with summary data\n     f. Send email to recipient\n     g. IF email sending fails, THEN log error and continue to next recipient\n     h. Update recipient's last summary timestamp\n   - Record job execution statistics (recipients processed, emails sent, failures)\n   - Update system with timestamp of last successful execution\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate job execution summary report\n   - Record total recipients processed\n   - Record total emails successfully sent\n   - Record any errors or exceptions encountered\n   - Log completion status of the job\n   - IF critical errors occurred, THEN generate admin notification",
