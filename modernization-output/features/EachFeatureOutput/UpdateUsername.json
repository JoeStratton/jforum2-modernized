Core Operation Execution\n   - Update username:\n     a. Store the previous username for audit purposes\n     b. Update the user record with the new username\n     c. IF update operation fails, THEN\n        i. Generate error message: \"Failed to update username\"\n        ii. Revert any partial changes\n        iii. Return operation error\n   - Update related records:\n     a. Identify any system records that reference the username directly\n     b. Update those references to maintain system integrity\n     c. IF related updates fail, THEN\n        i. Generate error message: \"Failed to update username references\"\n        ii. Revert all changes\n        iii. Return operation error\n\n5.
