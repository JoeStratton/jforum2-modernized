Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if poll is active\n     - IF poll has a length value greater than 0 THEN\n       - Calculate end time by adding length (in days) to start time\n       - IF current time is after end time THEN\n         - Mark poll as closed\n       - END IF\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Initialize vote counter to zero\n   - FOR EACH option in the poll options list:\n     - Retrieve the vote count from the option\n     - Add the option's vote count to the total vote counter\n   - END FOR\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the calculated total votes count\n   - Include poll status (open or closed) in the response\n   - IF total votes is zero THEN\n     - Include notification that no votes have been cast yet\n   - END IF",
