  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the incoming HTTP request object\n   - Collect the HTTP response object\n   - Collect the filter chain object for request processing\n   - All inputs are mandatory and system-provided\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the request object is not null\n     * IF request is null THEN generate error\n     * Error message: \"Request object cannot be null\"\n   - Validate that the response object is not null\n     * IF response is null THEN generate error\n     * Error message: \"Response object cannot be null\"\n   - Validate that the filter chain object is not null\n     * IF filter chain is null THEN generate error\n     * Error message: \"Filter chain object cannot be null\"\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if the filter has already been applied to this request\n     * Examine request attributes for the filter application marker\n     * IF filter marker exists THEN skip processing and proceed to next filter\n     * IF filter marker does not exist THEN mark the request as processed\n       - Set a filter application attribute on the request object\n   - Determine if the request is coming from a bot\n     * Extract user agent information from the request\n     * Compare user agent against known bot patterns\n     * IF user agent matches bot pattern THEN\n       - Identify the specific bot type\n       - Log the bot detection if debug logging is enabled\n       - Set a bot identification attribute on the request\n     * IF user agent does not match bot pattern THEN\n       - Set a non-bot identification attribute on the request\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Apply the filter to the request\n     * Mark the request with the filter application attribute\n     * Perform bot detection on the request\n     * Set appropriate bot/non-bot attributes on the request\n   - Continue the filter chain processing\n     * Pass the modified request to the next filter in the chain\n     * Allow the response to flow back through the filter chain\n   - Handle any exceptions during processing\n     * IF exception occurs during processing THEN\n       - Log the exception details\n       - Propagate the exception to the caller\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - No direct response modification is performed\n   - The request proceeds through the filter chain with added attributes:\n     * Filter application marker\n     * Bot identification status\n   - Any errors during processing are propagated as exceptions",
