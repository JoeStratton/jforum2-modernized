  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the source image (mandatory)\n   - Collect the image type (mandatory)\n   - Collect the target width (mandatory)\n   - Collect the target height (mandatory)\n   - System will determine the appropriate color model based on image type\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate source image is not null\n     * IF source image is null THEN return error message \"Source image cannot be null\"\n   - Validate target dimensions are positive numbers\n     * IF width <= 0 THEN return error message \"Target width must be positive\"\n     * IF height <= 0 THEN return error message \"Target height must be positive\"\n   - Validate image type is supported\n     * IF image type is not one of the supported types THEN return error message \"Unsupported image type\"\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Determine the appropriate color model for the target image\n     * IF image type is PNG and source image has transparency\n       THEN use color model with alpha channel support\n     * ELSE use standard RGB color model without transparency\n   - Calculate scaling factors\n     * Calculate horizontal scaling factor = target width / source width\n     * Calculate vertical scaling factor = target height / source height\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Create a new empty destination image with the specified dimensions and color model\n   - For each pixel position (x,y) in the destination image:\n     * Calculate the corresponding source position\n     * Calculate interpolation factors for x and y dimensions\n     * Get the four surrounding pixels from the source image\n     * Apply bilinear interpolation to calculate the new pixel color:\n       - Interpolate horizontally between top two pixels\n       - Interpolate horizontally between bottom two pixels\n       - Interpolate vertically between the two horizontal interpolation results\n     * Set the calculated color to the current pixel in the destination image\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the newly created image with smooth scaling applied\n   - IF any error occurs during processing\n     THEN return appropriate error message with details of the failure",
