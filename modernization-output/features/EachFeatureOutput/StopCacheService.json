  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - No user inputs required for this operation\n   - System-generated input: cache service reference\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Verify cache service status\n     a. Check if cache service is currently running\n     b. IF cache service is not running THEN\n        i. Log warning message about attempting to stop an already stopped service\n        ii. Exit process without further action\n     c. ELSE continue with shutdown process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify system readiness for cache shutdown\n     a. Check if any pending cache operations are in progress\n     b. IF pending operations exist THEN\n        i. Wait for pending operations to complete\n        ii. Set timeout period for waiting\n        iii. IF timeout exceeded THEN\n           1. Log warning about forced shutdown\n           2. Proceed with shutdown anyway\n     c. Check if cache contains unsaved data\n        i. IF unsaved data exists THEN\n           1. Attempt to persist critical data\n           2. Log any data that cannot be persisted\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Execute cache service shutdown\n     a. Notify dependent components about imminent shutdown\n     b. Release all cached resources\n     c. Stop the cache service\n     d. IF shutdown fails THEN\n        i. Log detailed error information\n        ii. Attempt graceful recovery\n        iii. IF recovery fails THEN\n           1. Force shutdown\n           2. Log critical error\n     e. Release system resources associated with cache\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate shutdown completion status\n     a. IF shutdown successful THEN\n        i. Log successful shutdown message with timestamp\n        ii. Return success status\n     b. ELSE\n        i. Log failure details\n        ii. Return error status with diagnostic information\n        iii. Include recovery suggestions",
