  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the uploaded file object (FileItem)\n   - Check if the file object is not null\n   - Verify the file has a name property\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the uploaded file object exists\n     - IF file object is null THEN return error message \"No file provided\"\n   - Validate that the file has a name\n     - IF file name is empty THEN return error message \"File has no name\"\n   - Validate that the file name contains an extension\n     - IF file name does not contain a period (.) THEN return error message \"File has no extension\"\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if extension has already been extracted\n     - IF extension is already stored and not empty THEN return the stored extension\n   - Determine the position of the last period in the file name\n     - Find the last occurrence of period (.) character in the file name\n     - IF no period is found THEN return error message \"Invalid file name format\"\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Extract the extension from the file name\n     - Get the substring of the file name starting from the position after the last period\n     - Store the extracted extension for future reference\n   - Normalize the extension if needed\n     - Convert extension to lowercase for consistency (optional)\n     - Remove any trailing whitespace or special characters (optional)\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the extracted file extension\n   - IF extraction was successful THEN return the extension string\n   - IF any errors occurred during extraction THEN return appropriate error message",
