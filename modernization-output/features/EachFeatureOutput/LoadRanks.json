  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - No user inputs required as this is a system operation\n   - System will use internal database connection credentials\n   - Operation triggered by system startup or manual refresh request\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Verify database connection is available\n     * IF connection is unavailable THEN generate connection error\n     * IF connection timeout occurs THEN generate timeout error\n   - Verify cache system is initialized\n     * IF cache is not initialized THEN initialize cache system\n     * IF cache initialization fails THEN generate cache error\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if ranking data already exists in cache\n     * IF ranking data exists in cache THEN clear existing data\n     * IF clearing cache fails THEN log warning and continue\n   - Verify ranking data access permissions\n     * IF system lacks permission to access ranking data THEN generate permission error\n     * IF ranking table is locked THEN implement retry mechanism\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Retrieve all ranking records from database\n     * Query the ranking data storage for all ranking entries\n     * Sort rankings by minimum post count in ascending order\n     * Group rankings by type (special vs regular)\n   - Process retrieved ranking data\n     * Format ranking titles for display\n     * Associate minimum post requirements with each rank\n     * Identify special ranks that are manually assigned\n   - Store processed ranking data in cache\n     * Organize data in cache using appropriate structure\n     * Set cache expiration policy if applicable\n     * Ensure atomic update of cache to prevent partial data issues\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate success response\n     * Include count of rankings loaded\n     * Include timestamp of data refresh\n   - Handle potential errors\n     * IF database error occurs THEN generate detailed error with database state\n     * IF cache storage error occurs THEN generate cache system error\n     * IF data format error occurs THEN generate data integrity error\n   - Log operation completion\n     * Record success or failure status\n     * Include performance metrics (load time, data size)",
