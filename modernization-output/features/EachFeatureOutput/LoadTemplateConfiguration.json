  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the filename (string) of the properties file containing HTML template mappings\n   - The filename must include the complete path to the file\n   - The file must be accessible by the system\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the filename is not empty or null\n   - Verify that the file exists at the specified path\n   - Confirm the file has read permissions\n   - Ensure the file is in a valid properties format\n   - IF any validation fails, THEN prepare appropriate error message\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if the cache system is properly initialized\n   - Verify the cache has sufficient capacity for storing template mappings\n   - Ensure no conflicting operations are modifying the same cache region\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Initialize a properties container to hold the template mappings\n   - Open the specified file for reading\n   - Load all key-value pairs from the properties file\n   - FOR each key-value pair in the properties file:\n     - Extract the template key (identifier)\n     - Extract the corresponding template filename/path value\n     - Store the mapping in the cache using the template key as identifier\n   - Close the file resource properly\n   - IF any error occurs during loading:\n     - Log the error details\n     - Clean up any partially loaded data\n     - Prepare appropriate exception with error context\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - IF operation completes successfully:\n     - Return success status\n     - Provide summary of loaded template mappings\n   - IF operation fails:\n     - Return failure status with detailed error information\n     - Include suggestions for resolving common issues\n     - Provide information about the current state of the cache",
