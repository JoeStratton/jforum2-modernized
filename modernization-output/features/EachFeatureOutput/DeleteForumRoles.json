Data Validation:\n   - Validate forumId:\n     a. Check if forumId is provided and is a positive integer\n     b. Verify the forum exists in the system\n     c. Return appropriate error message if validation fails\n   - Validate user permissions:\n     a. Verify current user has permission to manage forum security roles\n     b. Return appropriate error message if user lacks required permissions\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check system state:\n     a. Verify the system is not in maintenance mode\n     b. Ensure no conflicting operations are in progress\n   - Check dependencies:\n     a. Determine if any active sessions depend on these roles\n     b. Identify if any critical system functions rely on these roles\n   - IF critical dependencies exist THEN:\n     a. Generate warning about potential system impact\n     b. Request confirmation before proceeding\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Retrieve all security roles associated with the specified forum:\n     a. Query the system to identify all role IDs linked to the forumId\n     b. Create a list to store these role IDs for processing\n   - Execute deletion process:\n     a. Begin transaction to ensure data integrity\n     b. Construct a string of role IDs for batch processing\n     c. Delete all role-value associations for the forum using the role IDs\n     d. Commit transaction if all operations succeed\n     e. IF any operation fails THEN rollback transaction and log error details\n   - Update related records:\n     a. Update any cached security information in the roles repository\n     b. Clear relevant permission caches to ensure system consistency\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - For successful deletion:\n     a. Generate success message indicating roles were deleted\n     b. Include count of deleted roles in response\n     c. Provide timestamp of operation\n   - For failed deletion:\n     a. Generate detailed error message\n     b. Include error code and specific failure reason\n     c. Provide troubleshooting information\n   - Log the operation:\n     a. Record the operation details in system audit log\n     b. Include user who performed the operation, timestamp, and result",
