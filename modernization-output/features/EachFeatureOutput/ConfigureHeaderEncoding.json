Input Collection\n   - Collect the following input:\n     - encoding (string): The character encoding to be used when reading headers\n     - This field is optional; when not provided, the system will use platform default encoding\n\n2. Data Validation\n   - Validate the encoding input:\n     - IF encoding is provided:\n       - Check if the encoding is a valid character encoding name\n       - Verify the encoding is supported by the system\n       - IF encoding is invalid:\n         - Generate appropriate error message indicating invalid encoding format\n         - Abort the operation\n     - IF encoding is not provided (null):\n       - System will use platform default encoding\n       - No validation needed\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Check system state:\n     - Verify that the file upload component is properly initialized\n     - Ensure the component is in a state where encoding configuration is applicable\n   - Determine encoding application scope:\n     - The encoding will be applied to all subsequent file upload operations\n     - The encoding will only affect header parsing, not the content of uploaded files\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Store the encoding configuration:\n     - IF encoding is provided:\n       - Save the specified encoding value in the system configuration\n       - Update all relevant components to use the new encoding\n     - IF encoding is null:\n       - Reset to use platform default encoding\n       - Update all relevant components accordingly\n   - Apply the encoding setting to the multipart stream processor\n   - Ensure the encoding setting persists for the duration of the current session\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - Generate success response:\n     - Confirm the encoding has been successfully set or reset to default\n     - Include the current active encoding in the response\n     - Provide information about how this setting will affect file uploads\n   - IF any errors occurred:\n     - Generate appropriate error response\n     - Include specific details about why the encoding could not be set\n     - Provide guidance on valid encoding options",
