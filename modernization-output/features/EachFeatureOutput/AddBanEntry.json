Data Validation\n   - Validate ban entry object structure\n     - Ensure the ban entry has a valid type specified\n     - Ensure the ban value is not empty\n     - Verify the format of the ban value based on its type:\n       * IF type is IP, THEN validate IP address format\n       * IF type is email, THEN validate email format\n       * IF type is username, THEN validate username format\n     - Check that expiration date, if provided, is in the future\n   - IF any validation fails, THEN\n     - Generate appropriate error message\n     - Halt the process and return validation error\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Check for duplicate ban entries\n     - Retrieve current banlist from cache\n     - Check if an identical ban entry already exists\n     - IF duplicate found, THEN\n       * Generate duplicate entry error\n       * Halt the process\n   - Verify user has appropriate permissions to add ban entries\n   - Check system limits on number of ban entries if applicable\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Retrieve the current banlist map from cache\n     - IF banlist does not exist in cache, THEN create a new empty map\n   - Add the new ban entry to the banlist map\n     - Use the ban entry ID as the key\n     - Store the complete ban entry object as the value\n   - Update the banlist in the cache with the modified map\n   - Persist the ban entry to the database for permanent storage\n     - Create database record with all ban entry details\n     - Ensure database operation completes successfully\n   - IF database operation fails, THEN\n     - Remove the entry from cache\n     - Generate appropriate error message\n     - Halt the process\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - Generate success response\n     - Include confirmation message\n     - Include the ID of the newly added ban entry\n     - Include summary of the ban entry details\n   - Return success status with ban entry information\n   - Log the addition of the new ban entry for audit purposes",
