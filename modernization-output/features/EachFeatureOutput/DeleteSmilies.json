  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the IDs of smilies to be deleted\n     1.1. Retrieve the list of selected smilie IDs from the user interface\n     1.2. IDs are system-generated numeric identifiers\n     1.3. At least one ID must be selected for deletion\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate the selected smilie IDs\n     2.1. Verify that each ID represents an existing smilie in the system\n     2.2. Check that the ID is a valid positive integer\n     2.3. IF any ID is invalid or does not exist in the system THEN\n          2.3.1. Generate an error message indicating invalid selection\n          2.3.2. Abort the deletion process\n     2.4. IF no IDs are selected THEN\n          2.4.1. Generate an error message indicating that at least one smilie must be selected\n          2.4.2. Abort the deletion process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify system constraints before deletion\n     3.1. Check if any of the selected smilies are currently in use in posts\n     3.2. IF smilies are in use THEN\n          3.2.1. Determine if deletion would impact existing content\n          3.2.2. IF impact is significant THEN\n                 3.2.2.1. Generate a warning message for user confirmation\n                 3.2.2.2. Require explicit confirmation before proceeding\n     3.3. Verify that the user has appropriate permissions to delete smilies\n     3.4. IF user lacks permission THEN\n          3.4.1. Generate an access denied error message\n          3.4.2. Abort the deletion process\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Process the deletion of selected smilies\n     4.1. FOR EACH selected smilie ID:\n          4.1.1. Retrieve the complete smilie information including disk name\n          4.1.2. Delete the smilie record from the database\n          4.1.3. Locate the associated image file on the file system\n          4.1.4. IF image file exists THEN\n                 4.1.4.1. Delete the image file from the file system\n                 4.1.4.2. IF file deletion fails THEN\n                          4.1.4.2.1. Log the failure but continue with other deletions\n          4.1.5. IF any database operation fails THEN\n                 4.1.5.1. Log the error\n                 4.1.5.2. Roll back any partial changes if possible\n                 4.1.5.3. Generate an error message\n     4.2. Refresh the system's smilie repository to reflect the changes\n          4.2.1. Clear any cached smilie data\n          4.2.2. Reload smilie information from the database\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Provide feedback on the deletion operation\n     5.1. IF all deletions completed successfully THEN\n          5.1.1. Generate a success message indicating the number of smilies deleted\n          5.1.2. Display the updated list of remaining smilies\n     5.2. IF some deletions failed THEN\n          5.2.1. Generate a partial success message indicating which smilies were deleted\n          5.2.2. Include information about which smilies could not be deleted and why\n     5.3. IF all deletions failed THEN\n          5.3.1. Generate an error message with details about the failure\n          5.3.2. Provide suggestions for resolving the issue",
