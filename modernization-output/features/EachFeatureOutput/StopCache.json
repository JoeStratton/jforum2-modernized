  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - No user inputs required for this operation\n   - System-generated context information will be used\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Verify cache engine is currently in active state\n     - IF cache engine is not initialized or already stopped THEN\n       - Generate appropriate notification\n       - Exit process without further action\n     - END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check for pending operations\n     - IF critical write operations are in progress THEN\n       - Queue stop request until operations complete\n       - Set timeout for pending operations\n     - END IF\n   - Verify system state allows for cache shutdown\n     - IF system is in maintenance mode THEN\n       - Proceed with immediate shutdown\n     - ELSE\n       - Check for active user sessions\n       - IF active sessions exist THEN\n         - Log active session count\n       - END IF\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Prepare for cache shutdown\n     - Reject new cache requests\n     - Set cache system state to \"shutting down\"\n   - Flush modified data\n     - IF unsaved cache data exists THEN\n       - Write modified cache entries to persistent storage\n     - END IF\n   - Release resources\n     - Clear all cached objects\n     - Release memory allocations\n     - Close any open file handles or connections\n   - Update system status\n     - Set cache system state to \"stopped\"\n     - Update last shutdown timestamp\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate shutdown completion notification\n     - Include timestamp of shutdown\n     - Include statistics (cache hit ratio, uptime)\n   - Log cache shutdown event\n     - Record shutdown reason\n     - Record shutdown completion status",
