Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the group ID is a positive integer\n   - Verify that the group ID corresponds to an existing group in the system\n   - IF group ID is invalid or not found THEN\n      - Generate appropriate error message\n      - Terminate the operation\n   - ELSE continue to the next step\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify that the current user has administrative privileges to modify permissions\n   - Check if the permission system is active and properly configured\n   - IF user lacks necessary privileges THEN\n      - Generate access denied error\n      - Log the unauthorized attempt\n      - Terminate the operation\n   - ELSE continue to the next step\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Initialize the permission control system for the specified group\n   - Delete all existing role assignments for the specified group\n   - Prepare the system for new role assignments\n   - IF deletion of existing roles fails THEN\n      - Log the error details\n      - Attempt to restore previous state if possible\n      - Generate appropriate error message\n      - Terminate the operation\n   - ELSE continue to the next step\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate success response indicating permissions have been initialized\n   - Include the group ID in the response\n   - Provide information about next steps (such as assigning new permissions)\n   - Return control to the calling process",
