  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - No explicit input parameters required\n   - System configuration values are used internally:\n     - Database connection driver\n     - Database connection string\n     - These values are retrieved from system configuration\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate system configuration:\n     - Check if database connection driver is properly configured\n     - Verify database connection string is valid and properly formatted\n     - Ensure all required database parameters are available\n   - IF any configuration validation fails THEN:\n     - Generate appropriate error message\n     - Mark database status as unavailable\n     - Return error response with configuration issue details\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check system state:\n     - Verify if database driver class can be loaded\n     - Check if database is already marked as available or unavailable\n     - Determine if a test connection can be established\n   - Apply connection rules:\n     - Determine if connection pooling is enabled or disabled\n     - Check if system is in initialization phase or normal operation\n     - Verify if database is in a state to accept connections\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Acquire database connection:\n     - Request new connection directly from database driver\n     - Use system-configured connection string to establish connection\n     - Apply any connection-specific configurations\n     - Set appropriate timeout values if configured\n   - IF connection acquisition fails THEN:\n     - Log detailed error information\n     - Mark database as unavailable\n     - Prepare failure response with diagnostic information\n     - Throw appropriate exception with error details\n   - Test connection validity:\n     - Perform basic validation of the connection\n     - Verify connection is responsive\n     - Release test connection if in initialization phase\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - For successful connection:\n     - Return valid database connection to requestor\n     - Update system state to indicate database is available\n   - For failed connection:\n     - Include detailed error information\n     - Mark system state to indicate database is unavailable\n     - Provide error details in the exception\n   - Connection release handling:\n     - Properly close the connection when released\n     - Handle null connections gracefully during release\n     - Ensure all resources are properly closed",
