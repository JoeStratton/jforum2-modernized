Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the response object is properly initialized\n   - Verify that the response is still open and available for writing\n   - Check if the response has not been committed yet\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Determine if character encoding has been set\n   - IF no character encoding is set THEN\n     - Use the default system character encoding\n   - Check if content type has been set\n   - IF no content type is set THEN\n     - Use the default content type\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Request a PrintWriter instance from the response object\n   - IF the writer cannot be obtained THEN\n     - Generate appropriate error information\n     - Log the failure to obtain writer\n     - Return error status\n   - ELSE\n     - Prepare the writer for character output\n     - Set any required writer properties\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the PrintWriter instance to the caller\n   - IF any errors occurred during writer acquisition THEN\n     - Return appropriate error information\n     - Provide guidance on how to resolve the issue\n   - ELSE\n     - Return the successfully obtained PrintWriter",
