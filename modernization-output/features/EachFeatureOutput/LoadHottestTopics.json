  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection\n   - Retrieve the maximum number of hottest topics to load (limit) from system configuration\n   - System-generated input: cache engine reference for storing results\n\n2. Data Validation\n   - Validate that the limit is a positive integer\n     - IF limit <= 0 THEN\n       - Use default value from system configuration\n     - END IF\n   - Verify cache engine is properly initialized\n     - IF cache engine is null THEN\n       - Initialize cache engine\n     - END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Check if topic caching is enabled in system configuration\n     - IF topic caching is disabled THEN\n       - Skip caching operations but still retrieve topics\n     - END IF\n   - Determine if hottest topics are already cached\n     - IF hottest topics exist in cache AND cache is valid THEN\n       - Return cached topics without database access\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Access data layer to retrieve hottest topics\n     - Create data access object for topics\n     - Query database for topics with highest view or reply counts\n     - Limit results to specified maximum number\n   - Process retrieved topics\n     - Sort topics by popularity metrics (views, replies)\n     - Convert to appropriate data structure for caching\n   - Store topics in cache\n     - Add topics to cache with appropriate cache key\n     - Set expiration time according to system configuration\n   - Update cache status indicators\n     - Mark hottest topics as loaded in cache\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - Return the list of hottest topics\n   - Include metadata about cache status (freshly loaded or from cache)\n   - IF error occurs during processing THEN\n     - Return empty list\n     - Log error details\n   - END IF",
