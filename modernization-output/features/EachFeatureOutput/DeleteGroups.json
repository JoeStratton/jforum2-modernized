Business Rule Processing:\n   - Create a list to track any errors during the deletion process\n   - For each group ID in the selection:\n     * Verify if the group can be safely deleted\n       - Check if group has dependent relationships\n       - Ensure group is not required by the system\n     * IF group cannot be deleted THEN\n       - Add error message to the error list with group identifier\n       - Continue to next group in selection\n     * END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - For each group that passed validation:\n     * Remove group permissions and security settings\n     * Delete group associations with users\n     * Remove group from the system\n     * Update any related caches or repositories\n   - IF any errors occurred during deletion THEN\n     * Store error messages for display\n   * END IF\n\n5.
