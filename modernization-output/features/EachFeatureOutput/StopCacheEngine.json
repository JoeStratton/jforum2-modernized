Data Validation:\n   - Check if cache engine exists\n     - IF cache engine instance is null THEN\n       - Skip the operation as there is nothing to stop\n       - Log appropriate message indicating no cache engine is running\n     - ELSE\n       - Proceed to cache engine shutdown\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify system state is in shutdown mode\n   - Check for any pending cache operations\n     - IF critical operations are in progress THEN\n       - Wait for completion or set timeout\n     - ELSE\n       - Proceed immediately\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Notify cache engine to prepare for shutdown\n     - Release any exclusive locks\n     - Complete any pending write operations\n     - Flush any unsaved data to persistent storage if applicable\n   - Execute cache engine stop procedure\n     - Release all allocated resources\n     - Close any open connections or files\n     - Clear memory allocations\n   - Set cache engine reference to inactive state\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Log successful shutdown of cache engine\n   - IF shutdown encounters errors THEN\n     - Log error details\n     - Attempt emergency shutdown if possible\n     - Provide system administrators with diagnostic information\n   - ELSE\n     - Log successful completion of cache engine shutdown",
