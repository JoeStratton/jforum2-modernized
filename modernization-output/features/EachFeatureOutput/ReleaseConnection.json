Data Validation:\n   - Check if connection object is null\n     * IF connection is null THEN\n       - Skip release process\n       - Exit feature without error\n     * ELSE\n       - Proceed to connection release process\n   - Verify connection is in a state that can be released\n     * Check connection is not already closed\n     * Ensure connection belongs to the managed pool\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Determine if connection needs special handling before release\n     * Check for any uncommitted transactions\n     * Verify no statements are still open on this connection\n   - Prepare connection for return to pool\n     * Reset any connection-specific settings to default values\n     * Clear any connection warnings\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Release the database connection back to the connection pool\n     * Return the physical connection to the pool manager\n     * Update internal pool statistics\n     * Mark the logical connection as closed\n   - Handle any exceptions during release process\n     * Log exception details\n     * Ensure resources are properly cleaned up even if errors occur\n     * Suppress and contain exceptions to prevent propagation\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - No explicit response needed for successful operation\n   - For any errors during release:\n     * Log detailed error information\n     * Include connection identifier in error logs\n     * Provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting\n     * Contain errors within the release process to maintain system stability",
