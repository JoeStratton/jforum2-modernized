  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect connectionDriver from system configuration\n   - Collect connectionString from system configuration\n   - Both inputs are mandatory and system-generated from configuration settings\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate connectionDriver:\n     a. Check if connectionDriver is not null or empty\n     b. Verify connectionDriver class name follows proper naming convention\n     c. Generate error message if validation fails: \"Invalid or missing database driver\"\n   - Validate connectionString:\n     a. Check if connectionString is not null or empty\n     b. Verify connectionString follows proper format for database connection\n     c. Generate error message if validation fails: \"Invalid or missing connection string\"\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify system environment:\n     a. Check if required database driver is available in the system\n     b. Verify system has proper permissions to load the driver class\n     c. IF driver is unavailable THEN\n        i. Log error condition\n        ii. Prepare for failure response\n     d. IF permissions are insufficient THEN\n        i. Log security constraint violation\n        ii. Prepare for failure response\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Load database driver:\n     a. Attempt to load the database driver class using connectionDriver\n     b. IF driver loading fails THEN\n        i. Log initialization failure\n        ii. Prepare error response with driver loading details\n        iii. Mark database as unavailable\n   - Test connection:\n     a. Attempt to establish a test connection using connectionString\n     b. IF connection attempt fails THEN\n        i. Log connection failure with specific error details\n        ii. Prepare error response with connection failure information\n        iii. Mark database as unavailable\n     c. IF connection succeeds THEN\n        i. Release the test connection immediately\n        ii. Mark database as available\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Success response:\n     a. Generate confirmation that database connection initialization succeeded\n     b. Include status information about the connection\n     c. Provide reference to the initialized connection service\n   - Error response:\n     a. Include specific error details from failed operation\n     b. Provide troubleshooting information\n     c. Include suggestions for resolving the issue",
