  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the database connection object that needs to be released\n     1.1. Verify the connection object is provided\n     1.2. Check if the connection is of the expected type\n     1.3. Determine if the connection is in an active state\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate the connection object before attempting to release it\n     2.1. Check if the connection object is null\n        IF connection is null THEN\n          Skip the release process and return\n        END IF\n     2.2. Verify the connection is not already closed\n        IF connection status indicates it's already closed THEN\n          Log information that connection is already closed\n          Skip further processing\n        END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Apply business rules related to connection management\n     3.1. Check if there are any pending transactions on the connection\n        IF pending transactions exist THEN\n          Determine whether to commit or rollback based on system configuration\n          Log appropriate warning about releasing connection with pending work\n        END IF\n     3.2. Verify system state allows for connection release\n        IF system is in shutdown mode THEN\n          Use expedited release process\n        END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Execute the connection release operation\n     4.1. Attempt to close the database connection\n        TRY\n          Invoke close operation on the connection\n          Mark connection as successfully closed\n        CATCH any exceptions during close operation\n          Log the exception details\n          Record failed closure attempt\n        END TRY\n     4.2. Clean up any associated resources\n        Release any statement objects associated with the connection\n        Clear any connection-specific caches\n     4.3. Update connection tracking if applicable\n        Decrement active connection counter\n        Update connection usage statistics\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate appropriate response based on the release operation outcome\n     5.1. IF connection was successfully released THEN\n          Return success status\n          Include connection release timestamp\n     5.2. IF connection release failed THEN\n          Return error status\n          Include failure reason\n          Provide recovery suggestions\n     5.3. Generate any required notifications\n        IF connection pool is approaching capacity limits THEN\n          Generate system alert for administrators\n        END IF",
