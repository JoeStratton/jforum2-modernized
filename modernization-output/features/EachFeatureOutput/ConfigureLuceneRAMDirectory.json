  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect Analyzer object (mandatory)\n   - System will use the provided Analyzer for text analysis during indexing\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Verify Analyzer object is not null\n     * IF Analyzer is null THEN\n       - Generate error message: \"Analyzer cannot be null for Lucene configuration\"\n       - Abort operation\n     * END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check system resources availability\n     * Verify sufficient memory is available for RAM-based indexing\n     * IF memory is insufficient THEN\n       - Log warning about potential performance issues\n     * END IF\n   - Determine if existing index data needs migration\n     * IF existing index exists in another storage type THEN\n       - Prepare for migration of indexed data\n     * END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Initialize RAM Directory\n     * Create new RAM Directory instance\n     * Store directory reference in system configuration\n   - Create initial index structure\n     * Create new index writer using the RAM directory and provided analyzer\n     * Set index writer to create mode (overwrite any existing data)\n     * Initialize empty index structure\n     * Close index writer to commit changes\n   - Register RAM directory as active directory for search operations\n     * Update system configuration to use RAM directory for all search operations\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Success response\n     * Return confirmation that RAM directory has been successfully configured\n     * Include memory usage statistics for the newly created index\n   - Error response\n     * If configuration fails, provide detailed error information\n     * Include suggestions for troubleshooting common issues",
