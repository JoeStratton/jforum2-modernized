  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Receive modified node identifier (fqn) from the cache system\n   - Extract node path information from the identifier\n   - Determine if the node is a notification node\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the node identifier is not null\n   - Verify that the node path contains at least one element\n   - Check that the first element in the path can be cast to String\n   - Ensure the node path is properly formatted\n   - Generate appropriate error messages if validation fails\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - IF node identifier is valid THEN:\n     3.1. Extract the first element from the node path\n     3.2. Check if the extracted element is a String\n     3.3. Compare the extracted element with the notification prefix\n     3.4. Determine if the node is a notification node based on the comparison\n   - ELSE:\n     3.5. Skip processing as the node is invalid\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - IF the node is a notification node THEN:\n     4.1. Prepare for notification processing\n     4.2. Extract any relevant notification data from the node\n     4.3. Determine notification type and priority\n     4.4. Process the notification according to its type\n     4.5. Update any related cache entries if necessary\n   - ELSE:\n     4.6. Skip notification processing as this is a regular node modification\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - No explicit response is generated as this is an event handler\n   - Log completion of node modification handling if needed\n   - Ensure system state is consistent after processing",
