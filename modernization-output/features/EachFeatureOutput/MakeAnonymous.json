Input Collection:\n   - Collect the current UserSession object\n   - No additional user inputs required as this is a system-initiated operation\n   - The operation will use system-defined anonymous user ID\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Verify the UserSession object is valid and not null\n   - Verify the system has a properly configured anonymous user ID\n   - IF the session is already anonymous THEN\n     - Skip further processing\n     - Return with no changes\n   - END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if there are any pending operations that require authentication\n   - IF user has unsaved data or operations in progress THEN\n     - Determine if these operations should be preserved or discarded\n     - Prepare warning messages if applicable\n   - END IF\n   - Verify the anonymous user ID exists in the system\n   - Check if the current session has special permissions that will be lost\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Update session start time to current system time\n   - Update last visit time to current system time\n   - Set user ID to the system's anonymous user ID\n   - Remove auto-login cookies if present\n     - Clear the auto-login cookie\n     - Set the user data cookie to anonymous user ID\n   - Mark session as not logged in\n   - Reset any user-specific session attributes\n   - Preserve session ID to maintain the same browser session\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return updated UserSession with anonymous status\n   - Include information about the session change\n   - Provide any relevant messages about lost permissions or data\n   - Return navigation options for anonymous users",
