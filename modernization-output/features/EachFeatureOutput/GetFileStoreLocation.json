  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection\n   - Collect the DiskFileItem object instance\n     - This is the file item for which the storage location is needed\n     - No additional inputs are required as the method operates on the instance state\n\n2. Data Validation\n   - Validate the DiskFileItem instance\n     - Check if the DiskFileItem object is not null\n     - IF DiskFileItem is null THEN\n       - Return appropriate error indicating invalid input\n     - END IF\n   - Validate the internal state of the DiskFileItem\n     - Check if the DeferredFileOutputStream (dfos) has been initialized\n     - IF dfos is null THEN\n       - The file data may be in memory only with no disk representation\n       - Return null to indicate no disk storage location exists\n     - END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Determine the storage state of the file\n     - Check if the file is stored in memory or on disk\n     - IF file is stored entirely in memory THEN\n       - No physical file location exists\n       - Return null to indicate no disk storage location\n     - END IF\n   - Verify file accessibility\n     - Check if the temporary file exists and is accessible\n     - IF temporary file cannot be accessed THEN\n       - Return null or appropriate error\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Retrieve the file storage location\n     - Access the internal DeferredFileOutputStream object\n     - Request the File object from the DeferredFileOutputStream\n     - Capture the returned File object representing the temporary storage location\n   - Prepare the response\n     - Package the File object for return to the caller\n     - Ensure no file operations are performed that would alter the file state\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - Return the File object\n     - IF successful retrieval THEN\n       - Return the File object representing the temporary storage location\n     - ELSE\n       - Return null to indicate no file storage location exists\n     - END IF\n   - No additional metadata is returned with the File object",
