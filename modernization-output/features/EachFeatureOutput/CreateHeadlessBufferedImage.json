  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the source image (BufferedImage object)\n   - Collect the image type (integer constant)\n   - Collect the target width (integer)\n   - Collect the target height (integer)\n   - All inputs are mandatory\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate source image is not null\n     * IF source image is null THEN return error message \"Source image cannot be null\"\n   - Validate target dimensions are positive numbers\n     * IF width <= 0 THEN return error message \"Target width must be a positive number\"\n     * IF height <= 0 THEN return error message \"Target height must be a positive number\"\n   - Validate image type is supported\n     * IF image type is not one of the supported types THEN return error message \"Unsupported image type\"\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Determine the appropriate BufferedImage type based on input image type\n     * IF image type is PNG and source image has alpha channel\n       THEN use ARGB color model\n     * ELSE use RGB color model\n   - Check if system is headless\n     * IF system is not headless THEN log warning that headless method is being used unnecessarily\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Create a new BufferedImage with the target width, height, and determined color model\n   - For each pixel position (x,y) in the target image:\n     * Calculate the corresponding source pixel position\n     * Sample the color from the source image at calculated position\n     * Apply the color to the target image at current position (x,y)\n   - Apply nearest neighbor approximation to maintain efficiency\n     * For each target pixel, find the closest source pixel without interpolation\n     * Map source pixel RGB values directly to target pixel\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the newly created BufferedImage\n   - Include metadata about the transformation:\n     * Original dimensions\n     * New dimensions\n     * Color model used\n     * Approximation method used (nearest neighbor)\n   - IF any errors occurred during processing\n     THEN return appropriate error message and log the failure",
