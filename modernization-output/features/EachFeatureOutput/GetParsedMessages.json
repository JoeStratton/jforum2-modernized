  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect POPConnector object which contains connection details to the email server\n   - The connector must be properly initialized and connected to the email server\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the POPConnector object is not null\n   - Verify the connector has an active connection to the email server\n   - IF connector is null or not connected THEN\n     - Generate appropriate error message\n     - Exit process\n   - END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify the system has sufficient permissions to access the mailbox\n   - Check if the connection has timeout constraints\n   - Ensure the system can handle the potential volume of messages\n   - IF any business rule fails THEN\n     - Log the specific failure reason\n     - Generate appropriate error message\n     - Exit process\n   - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Initialize an empty list to store parsed messages\n   - Request the list of raw messages from the connector\n   - FOR each raw message in the retrieved list:\n     - Create a new parsed message object\n     - Extract message metadata (sender, recipient, subject, date)\n     - Extract message content (body, attachments if any)\n     - Add the parsed message to the messages list\n     - Log the successful retrieval of the message\n   - END FOR\n   - IF any error occurs during message parsing THEN\n     - Log the error details\n     - Continue with the next message\n   - END IF\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the complete list of successfully parsed messages\n   - Include count of successfully parsed messages\n   - Include count of messages that failed parsing (if any)\n   - IF no messages were found or parsed THEN\n     - Return empty list with appropriate status\n   - END IF",
