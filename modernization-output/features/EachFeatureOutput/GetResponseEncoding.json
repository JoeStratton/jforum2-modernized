Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify response state\n     - Check if the response is in a valid state to retrieve encoding\n     - IF response has been committed or closed THEN\n       - Log warning about retrieving encoding from committed response\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Retrieve character encoding\n     - Access the character encoding property from the response object\n     - IF encoding is not explicitly set THEN\n       - Return the default encoding used by the system\n     - ELSE\n       - Return the explicitly set encoding value\n     - END IF\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Format the encoding information\n     - Return the character encoding as a string value\n     - IF encoding could not be determined THEN\n       - Return null or appropriate indication of unavailable encoding\n     - END IF",
