  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect localeName (string): The identifier for the language file to monitor\n   - Retrieve fileChangesDelay (number): Time interval in milliseconds between file checks\n     - This value is system-generated from configuration settings\n     - Default value is determined by system configuration\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate localeName:\n     - Check if localeName is not null or empty\n     - Verify localeName exists in the available locales list\n     - IF localeName is invalid THEN generate appropriate error message\n   - Validate fileChangesDelay:\n     - Verify fileChangesDelay is a positive number\n     - IF fileChangesDelay is zero or negative THEN monitoring will be disabled\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if the language file is already being monitored\n     - IF language file is already being monitored THEN skip adding duplicate monitor\n   - Determine the full file path for the language file\n     - Combine base directory with locale-specific filename\n     - Verify file exists at the specified location\n     - IF file does not exist THEN generate appropriate error message\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Add localeName to the list of monitored languages\n   - IF fileChangesDelay is greater than zero THEN:\n     - Register a file change listener for the language file\n     - Configure the listener with:\n       - The full path to the language file\n       - The specified monitoring interval (fileChangesDelay)\n       - A callback action to execute when changes are detected\n   - When file changes are detected:\n     - Record monitoring activity in system logs\n     - Reload the language file with updated content\n     - Merge with default language if necessary\n     - Update the language cache with new translations\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Success response:\n     - Confirmation that monitoring has been established\n     - Details of the monitored file path\n     - The configured monitoring interval\n   - Error response:\n     - Specific error message describing the failure\n     - Suggestions for resolving the issue",
