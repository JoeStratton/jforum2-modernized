  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the following inputs:\n     a. listener (mandatory): The object that will be notified when file changes occur\n     b. filename (mandatory): The path to the file that needs to be monitored\n     c. period (mandatory): The time interval in milliseconds between file checks\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate the listener input:\n     a. Verify the listener is not null\n     b. Confirm the listener implements the required notification method\n     c. IF listener is invalid, THEN display an error message and abort operation\n   - Validate the filename input:\n     a. Verify the filename is not empty or null\n     b. Check if the filename represents a valid file path\n     c. IF filename is invalid, THEN display an error message and abort operation\n   - Validate the period input:\n     a. Verify the period is a positive number\n     b. Ensure the period is not too small to cause system performance issues\n     c. IF period is invalid, THEN display an error message and abort operation\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if the file exists:\n     a. Attempt to access the file at the specified path\n     b. IF file does not exist, THEN log a warning but continue setup\n   - Check if the file is already being monitored:\n     a. Look up the filename in the current monitoring registry\n     b. IF file is already monitored, THEN remove the existing monitor\n   - Verify system resources:\n     a. Ensure the system has sufficient resources to add another file monitor\n     b. IF resources are insufficient, THEN log an error and abort operation\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Create a monitoring task:\n     a. Initialize a new task with the listener and filename\n     b. Store the initial last modified timestamp of the file\n     c. Add the task to the monitoring registry with the filename as key\n   - Schedule the monitoring task:\n     a. Configure the task to run at the specified period intervals\n     b. Start the monitoring process\n     c. Log the successful addition of the file monitor\n   - Implement the file checking mechanism:\n     a. At each scheduled interval, check the current last modified timestamp\n     b. Compare it with the previously stored timestamp\n     c. IF timestamps differ, THEN update the stored timestamp\n     d. AND notify the listener about the file change\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - For successful monitor setup:\n     a. Return confirmation that the file is now being monitored\n     b. Include details about the monitoring frequency\n     c. Provide information on how to stop the monitoring\n   - For monitor removal:\n     a. Return confirmation that the file is no longer being monitored\n     b. Include information about when the monitoring was stopped\n   - For monitoring events:\n     a. When a file change is detected, notify the listener with file details\n     b. Include the filename that changed\n     c. Optionally provide the timestamp of the change",
