  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the file change listener object (mandatory)\n   - Collect the filename to monitor (mandatory)\n   - Collect the monitoring period in milliseconds (mandatory)\n   - System will use these inputs to set up file monitoring\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the listener object is not null\n     * IF listener is null THEN return error message indicating invalid listener\n   - Validate that the filename is not empty\n     * IF filename is empty or null THEN return error message indicating invalid filename\n   - Validate that the filename points to an existing file\n     * IF file does not exist THEN log a warning but continue processing\n   - Validate that the period is a positive number\n     * IF period is negative or zero THEN return error message indicating invalid monitoring period\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if the file is already being monitored\n     * IF file is already monitored THEN remove existing monitoring task\n   - Verify system resources are available for monitoring\n     * IF system cannot allocate resources for monitoring THEN return resource limitation error\n   - Log the monitoring operation with filename information\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Create a new monitoring task for the specified file\n     * Initialize task with the listener, filename, and current file state\n     * Store the file's current last modified timestamp\n   - Register the task in the monitoring system\n     * Add task to the collection of monitored files\n     * Schedule the task to run at specified intervals (period)\n   - Set up the monitoring mechanism\n     * Configure the task to check file modification time periodically\n     * Define the notification process when changes are detected\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return confirmation that monitoring has been established\n   - Include details about:\n     * The file being monitored\n     * The monitoring frequency\n     * How to cancel the monitoring later if needed\n   - Provide any warning messages if the file doesn't exist but monitoring was still set up",
