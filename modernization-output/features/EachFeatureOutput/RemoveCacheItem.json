  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect fullyQualifiedName (string, mandatory): The fully qualified name that identifies the cache location\n   - Collect key (string, mandatory): The unique identifier for the item within the cache\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate fullyQualifiedName:\n     a. Check if fullyQualifiedName is not null\n     b. IF fullyQualifiedName is null, THEN generate validation error: \"Fully qualified name cannot be null\"\n   - Validate key:\n     a. Check if key is not null\n     b. IF key is null, THEN generate validation error: \"Cache key cannot be null\"\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check cache system availability:\n     a. Verify the cache system is initialized and operational\n     b. IF cache system is not available, THEN generate error: \"Cache system is not available\"\n   - Check cache entry existence:\n     a. Verify the specified cache entry exists at the given fullyQualifiedName\n     b. IF entry does not exist, THEN generate notification: \"Cache entry not found\"\n     c. IF entry exists but doesn't contain the specified key, THEN generate notification: \"Cache item not found\"\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Locate the cache entry:\n     a. Access the cache storage using the fullyQualifiedName parameter\n     b. Retrieve the map associated with the fullyQualifiedName\n     c. IF map is found, THEN proceed to remove the item\n     d. IF map is not found, THEN skip removal operation\n   - Remove the cache item:\n     a. Remove the item with the specified key from the map\n     b. Release any resources associated with the cache item\n     c. Update cache statistics if applicable\n   - Handle removal exceptions:\n     a. IF any errors occur during removal, THEN log the error details\n     b. Ensure partial removals don't leave the cache in an inconsistent state\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Generate success response:\n     a. Indicate successful removal of the cache item\n     b. Include the fullyQualifiedName and key in the response for confirmation\n   - Generate error response (if applicable):\n     a. Include specific error details and reason for failure\n     b. Provide guidance on how to resolve the issue",
