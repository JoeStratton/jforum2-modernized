  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the application path (appPath) which represents the base directory of the application\n   - Collect the main configuration file path (mainConfigurationFile) which contains system defaults\n   - Both inputs are mandatory for system initialization\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate that mainConfigurationFile is not null\n     * IF mainConfigurationFile is null THEN\n       - Generate an error indicating configuration file cannot be null\n       - Halt the initialization process\n   - Validate that appPath points to a valid directory\n     * IF appPath is invalid THEN\n       - Generate an error indicating invalid application path\n       - Halt the initialization process\n   - Validate that mainConfigurationFile exists and is readable\n     * IF file does not exist or cannot be read THEN\n       - Generate an error indicating configuration file cannot be accessed\n       - Halt the initialization process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Initialize the global configuration system\n     * Create a new instance of the configuration manager\n     * Store the application path as a system property\n     * Store the default configuration file path as a system property\n   - Determine the installation-specific configuration file path\n     * Retrieve the installation configuration path from default settings\n     * Verify if the installation configuration file exists\n   - Process any additional configuration files\n     * For each additional configuration file in the list:\n       - Check if the file exists\n       - IF file exists THEN load its properties\n       - IF file does not exist THEN log a warning and continue\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Load default configuration properties\n     * Open and read the default configuration file\n     * Parse and store all key-value pairs from the file\n     * Close the file after reading\n   - Load installation-specific configuration properties\n     * IF installation configuration file exists THEN\n       - Open and read the installation configuration file\n       - Parse and store all key-value pairs from the file\n       - Close the file after reading\n     * ELSE\n       - Skip loading installation properties\n   - Initialize variable expansion system\n     * Set up the mechanism to expand variables in configuration values\n     * Clear any cached expansions\n   - Prepare the configuration system for use\n     * Ensure all required configuration properties are available\n     * Set up any derived properties based on loaded values\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the initialization status\n     * IF all configuration files loaded successfully THEN\n       - Indicate successful initialization\n       - Make configuration values available for retrieval\n     * ELSE\n       - Provide detailed error information about which files failed to load\n       - Include suggestions for resolving configuration issues",
