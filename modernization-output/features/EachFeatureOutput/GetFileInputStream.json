  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the FileItem object that contains the file data\n   - System determines if the file is stored in memory or on disk\n   - No additional user inputs are required\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Verify the FileItem object is not null\n     * IF FileItem is null THEN return appropriate error\n   - Verify the file data exists and is accessible\n     * IF file data cannot be accessed THEN return appropriate error\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check the storage location of the file content\n     * Determine if the file is stored in memory or on disk based on internal thresholds\n     * Verify access permissions to the file storage location\n     * IF storage location is inaccessible THEN return appropriate error\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - IF file is stored on disk:\n     * Locate the physical file on the disk storage\n     * Create a file input stream from the disk file\n     * Return the file input stream\n   - ELSE IF file is stored in memory:\n     * Check if cached content exists\n       * IF cached content does not exist THEN retrieve data from deferred file output stream\n     * Create a byte array input stream from the cached content\n     * Return the byte array input stream\n   - Handle any I/O exceptions that may occur during stream creation\n     * IF exception occurs THEN log error details and return appropriate error\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the created input stream for success case\n   - For error cases, return appropriate error information:\n     * File not found error if file doesn't exist\n     * Access denied error if permissions are insufficient\n     * I/O error if stream cannot be created\n     * Include error details to assist with troubleshooting",
