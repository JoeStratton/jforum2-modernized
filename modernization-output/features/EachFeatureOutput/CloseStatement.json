Data Validation:\n   - Validate Statement object existence\n     - IF Statement object is null THEN\n       - Skip processing and return without action\n     - ELSE\n       - Continue with resource release process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Verify Statement object state\n     - Check if Statement object is in a state that can be closed\n     - No additional dependencies need verification\n     - No resource availability checks required\n     - No business constraints to validate\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Clear Statement warnings\n     - Attempt to clear any accumulated warnings from the Statement\n     - IF warning clearance fails THEN\n       - Suppress the exception\n       - Continue with close operation\n     - ELSE\n       - Proceed to close operation\n   - Close Statement object\n     - Attempt to close the Statement object to release resources\n     - IF close operation fails THEN\n       - Suppress the exception\n       - Consider the operation complete despite failure\n     - ELSE\n       - Statement is successfully closed\n       - Resources are released back to the system\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - No explicit response is generated\n   - Operation completes silently\n   - No error responses are returned even if exceptions occur\n   - Operation is designed to be fail-safe with all exceptions suppressed",
