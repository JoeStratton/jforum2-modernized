  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection\n   - Collect the configuration file path (configFilePath) as a string\n   - System will use default path if not explicitly provided\n   - Configuration file must be in properties format\n\n2. Data Validation\n   - Validate configuration file path\n     - Check if file exists at the specified location\n     - Verify file has proper read permissions\n     - Confirm file has the correct format (.properties)\n   - IF file does not exist\n     - Generate appropriate error message\n     - Log error details\n     - Terminate process\n   - IF file exists but cannot be read\n     - Generate permission error message\n     - Log access error details\n     - Terminate process\n\n3. Business Rule Processing\n   - Check system readiness for URL pattern loading\n     - Verify system initialization is complete\n     - Ensure no conflicting operations are in progress\n   - Prepare resources for file reading operation\n     - Initialize property container for patterns\n     - Set up file input stream\n   - Validate file structure\n     - Check if file contains valid key-value pairs\n     - Verify pattern format compliance\n\n4. Core Operation Execution\n   - Open file input stream to the configuration file\n   - Load all properties from the file into memory\n   - FOR each key-value pair in the properties file\n     - Extract the pattern key (URL identifier)\n     - Extract the pattern value (URL pattern)\n     - Add the pattern to the URL pattern collection\n     - Log successful addition of pattern\n   - Close file input stream properly\n   - Handle any exceptions during file processing\n     - Log detailed error information\n     - Convert to appropriate system exception\n     - Ensure resources are properly released\n\n5. Response Generation\n   - Compile summary of loaded patterns\n     - Count of successfully loaded patterns\n     - List of any patterns that could not be loaded\n   - Log completion of URL pattern loading process\n   - Return success status or throw exception if process failed\n   - Notify dependent components about pattern updates",
