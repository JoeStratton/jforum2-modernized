  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect fully qualified name (fqn) as string (mandatory)\n   - Collect key as string (mandatory)\n   - System will use these to locate and remove the specific cached item\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate fully qualified name (fqn):\n     * Check if fqn is not null\n     * Check if fqn is not an empty string\n     * IF validation fails, THEN generate appropriate error message\n   - Validate key:\n     * Check if key is not null\n     * Check if key is not an empty string\n     * IF validation fails, THEN generate appropriate error message\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check if cache system is initialized:\n     * Verify that the cache storage mechanism is ready\n     * IF cache is not initialized, THEN report system error\n   - Check if the specified fqn exists in cache:\n     * Look up the fqn in the cache storage\n     * IF fqn does not exist, THEN no action is needed (silent operation)\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Retrieve the nested map associated with the fqn:\n     * Access the cache storage using the fqn as identifier\n     * Obtain the map of key-value pairs stored under this fqn\n     * IF map exists:\n       > Remove the entry with the specified key from the map\n       > No changes to other entries in the map\n     * IF map does not exist:\n       > No action required\n       > Operation completes successfully (silent operation)\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - For successful operation:\n     * No specific success response needed as this is typically a silent operation\n     * Cache state is updated with item removed\n   - For error conditions:\n     * Return appropriate error message based on validation failures\n     * Include details about which parameter failed validation",
