  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the DiskFileItem object that contains the file data\n   - No additional inputs required as the file information is encapsulated in the DiskFileItem\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Verify the DiskFileItem object is not null\n     * IF DiskFileItem is null THEN\n       - Return error indicating invalid file item\n   - Check if the file content is accessible\n     * IF file cannot be accessed THEN\n       - Return error indicating file access issue\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Determine the storage location of the file content\n     * IF file content is stored in memory THEN\n       - Prepare to retrieve from memory cache\n     * ELSE\n       - Prepare to read from disk storage\n   - Verify file size is within acceptable limits\n     * IF file size exceeds system limits THEN\n       - Return error indicating file size constraint violation\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Check if file content is already cached in memory\n     * IF content is cached in memory THEN\n       - Return the cached byte array directly\n     * ELSE IF content is in memory but not cached THEN\n       - Retrieve data from memory storage\n       - Cache the retrieved data for future use\n       - Return the byte array\n     * ELSE (content is stored on disk)\n       - Create a byte array sized to the file length\n       - Open a file input stream to the disk file\n       - Read the complete file content into the byte array\n       - Close the file input stream\n       - Return the populated byte array\n   - Handle any exceptions during file reading\n     * IF an error occurs during file reading THEN\n       - Ensure all resources are properly closed\n       - Return null or appropriate error indication\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the byte array containing the complete file contents\n   - IF operation was successful THEN\n     * Return the byte array with file content\n   - ELSE\n     * Return appropriate error information\n     * Include details about the nature of the failure (access error, file not found, etc.)",
