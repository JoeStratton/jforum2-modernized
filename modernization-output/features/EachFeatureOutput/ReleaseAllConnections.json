Data Validation:\n   - Verify connection pool exists\n     - IF connection pool is null THEN\n       - Generate error: \"Connection pool not initialized\"\n       - Exit process\n     - END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check system state for active operations\n     - IF critical database operations are in progress THEN\n       - Generate warning: \"Active operations detected\"\n       - Request confirmation to proceed\n       - IF confirmation denied THEN\n         - Exit process\n       - END IF\n     - END IF\n   - Verify administrator privileges\n     - IF current user does not have administrator privileges THEN\n       - Generate error: \"Insufficient permissions to release connections\"\n       - Exit process\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Log connection pool statistics before shutdown\n     - Record current active connections count\n     - Record idle connections count\n     - Record uptime statistics\n   - Initiate connection pool shutdown sequence\n     - Mark pool as shutting down to prevent new connections\n     - Wait for in-use connections to complete (with timeout)\n     - Release all idle connections\n     - Destroy connection pool resources\n     - Clear internal references to connection objects\n   - Update system state\n     - Mark database connection status as disconnected\n     - Update system availability indicators\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - IF shutdown completed successfully THEN\n     - Generate success response: \"All database connections successfully released\"\n     - Include statistics summary of released connections\n   - ELSE\n     - Generate error response with details of failed shutdown\n     - Include troubleshooting information\n     - Provide recovery steps for administrators\n   - END IF",
