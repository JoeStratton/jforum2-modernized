  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the following inputs:\n     - groupId (mandatory): A unique identifier for the group\n   - System will use the cache engine that was previously configured\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   - Validate groupId:\n     - Ensure groupId is provided\n     - Verify groupId is a positive integer\n     - IF groupId is invalid or missing THEN\n       - Generate appropriate error message\n       - Terminate process and return error\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Check cache availability:\n     - Verify the cache engine is properly initialized\n     - IF cache engine is not available THEN\n       - Log system error\n       - Prepare fallback mechanism or error response\n   - Determine cache retrieval approach:\n     - IF single groupId is provided THEN\n       - Prepare to retrieve roles for single group\n     - IF multiple groupIds are provided THEN\n       - Prepare to retrieve merged roles for multiple groups\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Retrieve roles from cache:\n     - Convert groupId to appropriate cache key format\n     - Query the cache using the FQN (fully qualified name) and the group identifier\n     - IF roles are found in cache THEN\n       - Retrieve the RoleCollection object\n     - ELSE\n       - Return null to indicate no roles found\n   - Handle any exceptions during retrieval:\n     - IF exception occurs during cache access THEN\n       - Log the error details\n       - Return appropriate error response\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Format the response:\n     - IF roles were successfully retrieved THEN\n       - Return the RoleCollection object containing all roles for the requested group(s)\n     - ELSE\n       - Return null to indicate no roles were found\n       - Include appropriate status information\n   - Provide context for response:\n     - Include information about the group(s) queried\n     - Include timestamp of when the data was retrieved",
