  "businessLogic": "1. Input Collection:\n   - Collect the following required inputs:\n     a. userId (number): The unique identifier of the user\n     b. hash (string): The activation key hash to validate\n   - Both fields are mandatory for this operation\n\n2. Data Validation:\n   a. Validate User ID:\n      - Verify that userId is a positive integer\n      - Verify that userId is not null or empty\n      - IF userId is invalid THEN\n        - Generate appropriate error message\n        - Return validation failure\n   b. Validate Hash:\n      - Verify that hash is not null or empty\n      - Verify that hash meets the required format and length\n      - IF hash is invalid THEN\n        - Generate appropriate error message\n        - Return validation failure\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   a. Verify User Existence:\n      - Check if the user with the provided userId exists in the system\n      - IF user does not exist THEN\n        - Generate user not found error\n        - Return validation failure\n   b. Verify Hash Association:\n      - Check if the provided hash is associated with the specified user\n      - IF hash is not associated with the user THEN\n        - Generate invalid association error\n        - Return validation failure\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   a. Validate Activation Key Hash:\n      - Compare the provided hash with the stored hash for the user\n      - Check if the hash is valid and not expired\n      - IF hash matches and is valid THEN\n        - Mark validation as successful\n      - ELSE\n        - Mark validation as failed\n   b. Handle Results:\n      - Record the validation attempt in the system\n      - IF validation was successful THEN\n        - Prepare success response\n      - ELSE\n        - Prepare failure response\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   a. For Successful Validation:\n      - Generate success response indicating the hash is valid\n      - Include any additional information about next steps\n   b. For Failed Validation:\n      - Generate failure response with appropriate error message\n      - Include information about why validation failed\n      - Provide guidance on how to proceed",
