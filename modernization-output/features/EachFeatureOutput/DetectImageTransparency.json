Data Validation:\n   - Validate that the provided image is not null\n     - IF image is null THEN\n       - Return an error indicating invalid input\n     - END IF\n   - Verify that the image is in a supported format\n     - IF image format is not supported THEN\n       - Return an error indicating unsupported image format\n     - END IF\n\n3. Business Rule Processing:\n   - Prepare to analyze the image's color model\n   - Ensure the system can access the image data\n     - IF image data cannot be accessed THEN\n       - Return an error indicating inability to process image\n     - END IF\n\n4. Core Operation Execution:\n   - Extract a sample of the image's pixel data\n     - Use a minimal sample (such as a single pixel) for efficiency\n   - Retrieve the color model from the pixel data\n     - IF pixel data extraction fails THEN\n       - Handle the interruption gracefully\n       - Return false (assume no transparency)\n     - END IF\n   - Analyze the color model to determine if it supports alpha channel\n     - Check if the color model has an alpha component\n\n5. Response Generation:\n   - Return the transparency detection result\n     - IF color model has alpha channel THEN\n       - Return true (image has transparency)\n     - ELSE\n       - Return false (image has no transparency)\n     - END IF\n   - In case of any processing errors or interruptions:\n     - Return false as the default fallback value\n     - Log the error for troubleshooting purposes",
