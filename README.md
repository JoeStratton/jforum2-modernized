# jforum2
JForum 2.x series

JForum was a bulletin board software based on PHPBB which I wrote back in the 2000's. It was my first big open source project, and I worked on it for several years. There are still code from my early Java days, and you can still see the tradicional MVC implementation. 

In the gold Java years it was used by some big sites, like JavaRanch.com, GUJ.com.br (biggest java community in Brazil) and Sony Online Entertainment. 

I have ceased development and maintenance for several years already, and I only keep the code alive for historial reasons. I do not intend to apply fixes or develop new features. 

Keep in mind that this a very old codebase.

## Modernization Project

This repository has been modernized using the **HAI Agent Framework** to convert the legacy JForum2 application to a modern Spring Boot application.

### Modernization Tools Used

- **HAI Agent Framework** - AI-powered code modernization platform
- **HolisticAnalyzerAgent** - Analyzed legacy application architecture and folder structure
- **FeatureExtractorAgent** - Extracted 400+ features from Java source files
- **FeatureDocumentationAgent** - Generated comprehensive feature documentation
- **DeveloperAgent** - Created modern Spring Boot boilerplate and implementation
- **Langfuse** - Tracing and observability for the modernization process
- **AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)** - Large Language Model for code analysis and generation

### Modernization Output

The modernized Spring Boot application can be found in:
```
modernization-output/
├── analysis/                    # Legacy application analysis reports
├── features/                    # Extracted features from legacy code
├── documentation/               # Comprehensive feature documentation
└── spring-boot-app/            # Modern Spring Boot implementation
```

### Running the Modernization

To run the complete 6-step modernization workflow:

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and configure your API keys
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the modernization: `npm run dev`

The workflow will automatically:
1. Analyze the legacy application architecture
2. Extract features from Java source files
3. Generate comprehensive documentation
4. Create a modern Spring Boot boilerplate
5. Implement all features in Spring Boot
6. Generate tests and deployment configurations
